Now you will need one tool to make requests and interact whith your API. Some famous API Clients are <a href="https://insomnia.rest/download">Insomnia</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client">Thunder CLient</a> to VSCode users, <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> and many others, like browsers plugins. If you dont use to complex jobs any of these will help you.

- **GUIDE** :

  **HTTP METHOD** - _/route_ - Little description of it behaviour.

  ```
    Received or sended object schema.
    Ex: {
    "text":"Lorem ipsum..."
    }
  ```

  _Final thoughts about API behaviour_

  ***

  Exemple:

  **GET** - _/health_ - API return status 200 with object below.

  ```
  {
    "message":"I'm Alive!"
  }
  ```

  Simple way to verify if API is up. _Maybe is not implemented on this project_

  ***

  **Usage** - In this case you will make a GET request on http://localhost:5000/health. And will receive the JSON object "message: I'm Alive!" on the console, terminal or display, depending on the case.

  ***

**LET'S GO** - API description.

**POST** - _/participants_ - API verify existing users online with same name and, if don't have, includes user on mongoDB.

```
  {
  "name":""
  }
```

This route have setTimeout to verify activity, if user frontend dont send new requests in 10 seconds, this user are removed.

**GET** - _/participants_ - API return one array with online users.

```
  [{
   "name":"john"
  },{
   "name":"will"
  },...]
```

**POST** - _/messages_ - Send message to API redirect for one user or all chat.

HEADER:

```
{
  "user":""
}
```

BODY:

```
{
  "to":"",
  "text":"",
  "type":""
}
```

Valid types: ["message", "private_message"].

"message": all users can see on chat.

"private_message": only the one user you sended.

**PUT** - _/messages/:message_id_ - User can edit the message, need id from mongoDB.

```
{
  "to":"",
  "text":"",
  "type":""
}
```

**DELETE** - _/messages/:message_id_ - User can delete the message.

```
{}
```
